## Digital Fabrication Unlocked

This course is going to be a fun and intensive hands-on dive into the world of digital fabrication. Be prepared for practical use of the up to date digital fabrication equipment at the Fab Lab. You will learn 3D printing, laser cutting and CNC milling along with electronics and programming basics with Arduino and the Raspberry Pi. Other machines at the Fab Lab will be available if your project specifically will need one.

After the course you will understand the bigger picture of maker-spaces and fab-labs, what to expect, what can be found in these spaces and how to use that to transform your ideas into tangible artifacts efficiently.
